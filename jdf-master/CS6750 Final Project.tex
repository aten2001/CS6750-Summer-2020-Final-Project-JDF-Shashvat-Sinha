\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Interface Description}
The interface we have chosen to redesign is the on-screen keyboard for Xbox One consoles. This interface shows up whenever a user has to type in characters from a keyboard into a textbox. It is used for searching, username and password input and the Xbox Live short message service. The keyboard is operated by utilizing the Xbox controller to select letters to be typed, one by one. The keyboard made its appearance with the release of the Xbox One in November 2013.

In order to use the keyboard, one must have an Xbox One console. Using it, navigate to any screen that requires textual input, for example the search box on the Microsoft Store page, or the password input page on the wireless network configuration screen.

A detailed description of the keyboard is given on the portfolio page of the designer, Matthew Hartmen (\cite{hartman_2013}).
